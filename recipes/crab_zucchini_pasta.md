# Broken Pasta with Lemon Crab & Courgette 

    
## Ingredients

* 1 small courgette
* 1/2 red chilli
* zest and juice of 1/2 lemon
* glug of extra virgin olive oil
* sea salt
* 8 dried lasagne sheets
* 70g white crab meat
* freshly ground black pepper

## Instructions

Break each lasagne sheet into two or three pieces, and cook in a pan of boiling, salted water for about 7 minutes until just tender. You can use any type of pasta shape for this dish, but using broken lasagne sheets gives things a stylish, homemade pasta/ dinner party-type feel.

Meanwhile, create ribbons out of the courgette using a vegetable peeler, and finely chop the red chilli. Toss together with the lemon juice and zest, a glug of olive oil and a good pinch of sea salt.

Drain the pasta, and toss it together with the seasoned courgette ribbons and the fresh crab meat. Serve straightaway in warm bowls, each finished with a good grind of black pepper.
